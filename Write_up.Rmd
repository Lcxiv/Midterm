\section*{Introduction}

After struggling quite a bit with R Markdown. Here is my final write up. 
Aim training is an essential basis of most video games that include any type of fighting mechanic that are not assisted by any software. It may range from moving your mouse and click at the right time on the target or simply follow the target for a specific amount of time. These scenarios are supposed to recreate the type of action you may encounter in some games to focus on your weaknesses or simply to get better at in an area. In theory, aim trainers are supposed to make you aim better in different games if you create the same environment.

\subsection{History}

A lot of aim trainers have emerged during these last years with the growing of esport and their prize pools. These games are mostly used for first and third person shooters in which you require precise aiming in any situation. Counter Strike Global Offensive, Overwatch, Fortnite, are great examples of games requiring a consistent aim in which pros have recognized using aim trainers as a form of practice. There are a lot of aim trainers, varying from being free to around $15. 

\subsection{Kovaak}

Kovaak is the aim trainer I decided to analyze since I already bought it before this class. Kovaak is recognized as one of the best aim trainer due to its great number of different scenarios as well as the customization possible by the players. It is important to be noted that anyone can create scenarios as they wish, which helps having a wide variety of scenarios for most of the games. There is also a possibility to extract your data under the form of excel files. However, their format is not great and could use some rework (as I realized).

\subsection{Player}

I thought this section could be useful to bring more light to the results later. I started playing Kovaak on a non-consistent basis about a year ago. I started by doing the most popular scenarios and slowly started to follow some guides. I quickly improved at first but I was not sure if the time put in playing it was worth the improvement. Also, there seemed to be a lack of solid correlation between playing the aim trainer or directly playing the main game. These two factors led to inconsistent data over time.

\section*{Packages}

Most of the packages used for this project consisted of tools to extract and format the data. Formatting the data was my greatest challenge because of the way it was extracted form the game.

1. data.table
 + Helped with data manipulation.
2. dplyr
 + Helped with data manipulation.
3. tidyverse
 + Commong package that offers a lot of possibilities for data science.
4. fs
 + This package was really helpful dealing with the data from my directory to import them into R.
5. lubridate
 + Helped with date formatting.
6. sqldf
 + Sqldf is the only one that is a bit different from the others. It is used to take advantage of the SQL language and syntax. This package helped my code to be clearer and more understandable by using tables names.
7. magrittr
 + Used mainly for the pipe operator
8. ggpubr
 + Used to add ggplots on the same layout.

\subsection{Graph 1}
![Bounce Scenario Example](/Users/Louis/Desktop/CADS/510/Midterm/Pictures/one_wall_ex.jpg)

To bring more context, the "one wall five targets pasu" scenario is considered to be an intermediate/advanced scenario. It requires "clicking" and "tracking" to get a good score. To get a score, you need to click on as many targets as possible during a minute. These targets move midly fast on the rectangle grid in random direction. Therefore, to get a good score, you need to anticipate the trajectory of the target as well as tracking it at the same time. You also need to be able to switch fast between targets.

This graph shows that not only it lacks data over time but also that there does not seem to be a real progression. As stated previously in the "Player" section, I started to play this scenario less because I either wasn't training my aim anymore or that I started playing different scenarios. Other reasons affected the results but I will discuss it in another section.

\subsection{Graph 2}

![Bounce Scenario Example](/Users/Louis/Desktop/CADS/510/Midterm/Pictures/bounce_ex.jpg)

The bounce scenario differs from the previous one because of the space the balls can go as well as the field of view. This scenario is also considered as intermediate and focuses more on tracking since the balls do not go as fast and follow the same pattern. The place they spawn is what will determine their trajectory but you also may need to react fast since they can collide into each others.

![Bounce Scenario Over 5 Months](/Users/Louis/Desktop/CADS/510/Midterm/Pictures/Bounce_scenario.png)

As seen on the graph, I played this scenario way more consistenly than the last one. However, there does not seem to show progression, but instead the opposite. However, the results can still be considered as correct since the accuracy did not go below 70% as a whole.

\subsection*{Data Visualization Summary}

Both of these graphs did not show any kind of constant progression over time. A few reasons could explain these somewhat inconsistent results. Extraneous variables played a big role in the results such as the time the scenario was played (i.e, morning vs afternoon), the difficulty of the scenario, the position it was played (i.e, use of guides), as well as the number of times played in a row. All of these reasons focus more on the routine of the player and may affect the results. We could also include what is called the "plateau effect."
Moreover, any hardware change could greatly influence the results such as a changing a mouse, monitor etc...
Finally, it is indeed really hard to create some baseline to measure progression over time and keep each variable the same. The player may feel the need to change some of these to acquire more comfort or because he may think the change will show a greater progression over time. 

\section*{Summary}

This project was quite difficult for reasons that I did not expect. I have never been realy familiar with R and especially doing data transformation in R. I guess it was the perfect data set to explore because of the way it was constructed and what I had to do to make it fit what I expected it to be. Unfortunately, I could not get rid of the formatting errors in the tables that you specified. 
Overall, adding all these little parts together was fun and I learnt a lot. Obviously, there is a lot of room for improvement especially since I have been stupid enough to not commit to git and made Rstudio crash on me erasing my progression (lesson learnt!).

\subsection*{Future}

I hope that I will find a better way to collect data either from this aim trainer or another to avoid loosing that much. This would greatly help to create  better functions and make it more accessible to others.
Still thinking of adding new games.
