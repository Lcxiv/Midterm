# Midterm

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from an aim trainer named "Kovaak." The objective is to extract the data, clean the results and compare it 
to different games in the future. By comparing the data from this aim trainer, one may be able to determine if aim trainers are beneficial or not (and to 
which extent) in different games. Right now, the project is only extracting the data from Kovaak and is not extracting any other game. The "stats" file
contains some of my own data that I used.
